Inintally, I am working with
1. sqlparse -> to parse sql statement and get type of sql statement
2. sql-metadata -> to get table name (from SELECT command)
3. sql-validator -> to validate sql select command
4. click -> for command line utility deal with --version etc. commands
5. tabulate -> to show things in table
now, check cmd module to create command line apps commands.
Then, work with pickle
and, write data structure, starting with Linked List, then, stack -> queue -> Tree -> Graph
